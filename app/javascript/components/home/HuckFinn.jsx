  <h2>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</h2>
  <p>
      YOU don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of
      The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. &nbsp;That
      book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. &nbsp;There
      was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. &nbsp;That is
      nothing. &nbsp;I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without
      it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. &nbsp;Aunt Polly—Tom’s
      Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about
      in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said
      before.

    Now the way that the book winds up is this: &nbsp;Tom and me found the
    money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. &nbsp;We got
    six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. &nbsp;It was an awful sight of
    money when it was piled up. &nbsp;Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put
    it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
    round—more than a body could tell what to do with. &nbsp;The Widow
    Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it
    was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
    and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t
    stand it no longer I lit out. &nbsp;I got into my old rags and my
    sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. &nbsp;But Tom Sawyer he
    hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might
    join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. &nbsp;So I went
    back.

      The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
      called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.
      She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but
      sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. &nbsp;Well, then, the old thing
      commenced again. &nbsp;The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to
      come to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to
      eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and
      grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really
      anything the matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was
      cooked by itself. &nbsp;In a barrel of odds and ends it is different;
      things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go
      better.

      After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
      Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by
      she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then
      I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock
      in dead people.
